# No Gang Colors: About

This repository houses an archival website presenting music compositions by No Gang Colors. 
It is code and data organized to display No Gang Colors's discographic works and mixtape series. 
The audio files are stored outside of GitHub on the Internet Archive.
No Gang Colors is for musicians and composers who want a simple way to organize and share their work.
We encourage artists to escape mediated, transactional third-party platforms in favor of less-encumbered more-sustainable systems. 
Contact [mail@nogangcolors.com](mailto:mail@nogangcolors.com) with suggestions, questions or to chat.
