# No Gang Colors: Guide

This repository houses an archival website presenting music compositions by No Gang Colors. 
It is code and data organized to display No Gang Colors's discographic works and mixtape series. 
The audio files are stored outside of GitHub on the Internet Archive.
No Gang Colors is for musicians and composers who want to have a simple way to organize and share their work.
We encourage artists to escape mediated, transactional third party platforms in favor of unencumbered more-sustainable systems.
