# No Gang Colors: About

This repository contains an archival website presenting music compositions by No Gang Colors. 
It is code and data organized to display No Gang Colors's discographic works and mixtape series. 
The audio files are stored outside of GitHub on the Internet Archive.
We encourage artists to escape mediated, transactional third-party platforms in favor of less-encumbered more-sustainable systems.
No Gang Colors consists of a static body of work through a dynamic presentation.
